<li>Mongoose</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Command Terminal</li>
<li>Curl scripts</li>
<li>Heroku</li>

<h2>Development Process:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Team worked together on getting the repositories for both client and api up and running</li>
<li>Team of three: Scott Holm, Katherine Ward, Jason Vo</li>
<li>We started out with each person working on a feature. One person worked on the user authentication in the front end, one person set up the handlebars in the front end, and the last person worked on setting up the backend.</li>
<li>Made a new file and set up our item model schema and its parameters (name, price, quantity) in the models folder.</li>
<li>Made a new file and set up our item routes</li>
<li>Require route files in server.js and register route files.</li>
<li>Created an item folder under scripts that contain curl scripts for each crud action. (create, destroy, index, show, update)</li>
<li>Test curlscripts and once successful, move to client side and start making the connection between client and api.</li>
</ul>
